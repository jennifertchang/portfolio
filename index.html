    <h1>Jennifer Chang</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Jennifer Chang and I am currently a second year at UC San Diego majoring in Data Science.
        I'm interested in leveraging the applications of data science to help make calculated business decisions and help non-profits in achieving their goals.
